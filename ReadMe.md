## Here's how I started the project

Create a fresh remix-adonisjs project using the Remix starter template:

`npm init adonisjs@latest -- -K="github:jarle/remix-starter-kit"`

You should now be able to start building! Just jump into your new folder and start the dev server with 

`npm run dev`.

The project follows the conventional AdonisJS structure, with the Remix application being placed in resources/remix_app.

A good next step could be to follow [our guide on how to build a login flow](https://matstack.dev/remix-adonisjs/hands-on/building-a-login-flow) for your new application.

## Then

After following the above to create a project and build the  login flow, I began adding other athentication basics 
such as reset password, email confirmation, contact support form.
